svc_dash
========

Project that try to solve the challenges during the client-server uploading and server-client downloading of mobile videos proposing a new approach involving SVC and DASH with the final goal to improve content availability by reducing the end-to-end delay from the recording time of the modile videos to the publishing of the first segment of the encoded version of the video in the Server in order to be available and playable on other devices.

# Video producer and uploader
The video producer and uploader uses the [JSVM](http://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/de/kompetenzfelder/image-processing/research-groups/image-video-coding/svc-extension-of-h264avc/jsvm-reference-software.html) library to encode and decode the video file (mostly yuv file).
